# Churn prediction Project

A predictive Churn Model is a straightforward classification tool: look at the user activity from the past and check to see who is active after a certain time and then create a model that probabilistically identifies the steps and stages when a customer (or segment) is leaving your service or product.

Having a predictive churn model gives you awareness and quantifiable metrics to fight against in your retention efforts. This gives you the ability to pattern habits of customers who leave, and step in before they make that decision. Without this tool, you would be acting on broad assumptions, not a data-driven model that reflects how your customers really act.

Without a strong understanding of your customers and their behaviors, itâ€™s hard to retain them so the first step in creating this model is understanding your customer behavior from customer data points. Lets see what kind of data do we need to to asses the triggers that caused them to ultimately leave your company.
